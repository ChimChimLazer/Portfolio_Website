<h2>Noughts & Crosses</h2>
<p>This project is a simple recreation of the popular childrens game Noughts & Crosses (Also know as Tick Tack Toe). In the game there is a 3 by 3 grid and players take turns to either place an X or a O on one of those spaces. The first player to get 3 of their letter in a row wins the game</p>
<h3>Programming Language</h3>
<p>The programming language used for this application was C++. This was my first project in the language and I used it to learn some of the syntax as well as some other features in the languge that I was not used to e.g. pointers.</p>
<h3>Console</h3>
<p>This project is a console application. It displays the noughts and crosses board using a text.</p>
