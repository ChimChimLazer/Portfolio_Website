## Noughts & Crosses
This project is a simple recreation of the popular childrens game Noughts & Crosses (Also know as Tick Tack Toe). In the game there is a 3 by 3 grid and players take turns to either place an X or a O on one of those spaces. The first player to get 3 of their letter in a row wins the game
### Programming Language
The programming language used for this application was C++. This was my first project in the language and I used it to learn some of the syntax as well as some other features in the languge that I was not used to e.g. pointers.
### Console
This project is a console application. It displays the noughts and crosses board using a text.
